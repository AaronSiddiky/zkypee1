# Security Fixes for Critical Vulnerabilities

This document outlines the security fixes implemented to address the critical vulnerabilities found in the application.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. **Anonymous Twilio Token Generation**: Previously, anyone could generate valid Twilio tokens without authentication, giving direct access to Twilio voice services.

2. **No Rate Limiting on Token Generation**: The application had no rate limiting, allowing attackers to rapidly generate tokens at scale.

3. **Permissive CORS Configuration**: The API allowed cross-origin requests from any domain, enabling attackers to build malicious websites that could exploit the system.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Secure Twilio Token Generation

- **Authentication Required**: Modified `/api/twilio/token` to require authentication via Supabase session.
- **Removed Anonymous Endpoint**: Deleted the GET endpoint that allowed unauthenticated token generation.
- **Reduced Token TTL**: Decreased token lifetime from 1 hour to 15 minutes for better security.

### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation

- **Created Rate Limiting Utility**: Implemented a rate limiting utility in `lib/rate-limit.ts`.
- **Token Generation Limits**: Limited token generation to 5 requests per minute per IP address.
- **Proper Error Handling**: Added clear error responses for rate-limited requests with 429 status codes.

### 3. Restrictive CORS Configuration

- **Allowed Origins Whitelist**: Updated middleware to only set CORS headers for approved origins.
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Used `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable to define the primary allowed origin.
- **Preflight Request Handling**: Properly handled OPTIONS requests with secure CORS headers.

### 4. Client-Side Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Updated the TwilioContext to properly handle authentication and rate-limiting errors.
- **Same-Origin Credentials**: Ensured proper credentials are sent with token requests.
- **Removed Anonymous Fallbacks**: Eliminated any fallbacks to "anonymous" identities in token requests.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Implement Server-side Rate Limiting Storage**: For production, consider replacing the in-memory rate limiting store with Redis or another distributed cache.

2. **Add API Request Logging**: Implement detailed logging for token requests to monitor for potential abuse.

3. **Regular Token Auditing**: Periodically review token generation logs to identify suspicious patterns.

4. **Add CSRF Protection**: Consider implementing CSRF tokens for additional API security.

5. **Enable HTTP Security Headers**: Add Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options and other security headers.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the application to ensure:

1. Authenticated users can still make calls successfully
2. Unauthenticated requests for tokens are properly rejected
3. Rapid token requests are rate-limited
4. Cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains are blocked
