# Credit System Implementation Plan with Stripe and Supabase

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for a credit system that allows users to add funds to their account via Stripe and use those credits for calls at a rate of $0.15 per minute. The system will be built using Stripe for payment processing and Supabase for database management.

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

### 1.1 Environment Setup

- Set up Stripe account and obtain API keys (test and production)
- Configure Supabase project and obtain API keys
- Create necessary environment variables for secure key storage
- Dont use webhooks

### 1.2 Database Schema Design

- Create a `users` table in Supabase with credit balance field
- Create a `transactions` table to track all credit purchases
- Create a `call_logs` table to track call usage and credit deductions
- Set up appropriate relationships between tables
- Implement row-level security policies for data protection

## Phase 2: Credit Purchase Implementation

### 2.1 Credit Package Configuration

- Define credit packages in the system:
  - $5 package
  - $10 package
  - $20 package
  - $50 package
  - $100 package
- Map dollar amounts to credit values (1:1 ratio or custom conversion)

### 2.2 Stripe Integration for Payments

- Implement Stripe Checkout for seamless payment experience
- Create product and price objects in Stripe for each credit package
- Set up payment success and cancel URLs
- Implement server-side confirmation of payments
- Configure Stripe webhooks to capture payment events

### 2.3 Credit Addition Flow

- Create API endpoint to initiate credit purchase
- Implement Stripe session creation
- Handle successful payment webhook from Stripe
- Update user's credit balance in Supabase
- Record transaction details in the transactions table
- Send confirmation email/notification to user

## Phase 3: Call System Integration

### 3.1 Call Tracking Mechanism

- Implement call start/end time tracking
- Calculate call duration in minutes
- Determine credit cost based on duration (at $0.15 per minute)
- Create pre-call credit check to ensure sufficient balance

### 3.2 Credit Deduction System

- Create real-time or post-call credit deduction logic
- Update user's credit balance after each call
- Handle partial minute billing (round up or prorate)
- Implement credit threshold warnings during calls
- Create call termination logic for depleted credits

### 3.3 Call History and Reporting

- Record detailed call logs with duration and cost
- Provide user-facing call history with credit usage
- Implement admin reporting for call and credit usage analytics
- Create export functionality for reports

## Phase 4: User Interface and Experience

### 4.1 Credit Management UI

- Design and implement credit balance display
- Create credit purchase interface with package options
- Implement transaction history view
- Design low-balance notifications and warnings

### 4.2 Call Interface Integration

- Display current credit balance in call interface
- Show real-time credit usage during calls
- Implement remaining talk time estimates
- Create credit top-up prompts for low balances

### 4.3 Account Management

- Implement credit balance in user profile/dashboard
- Create credit usage analytics for users
- Design auto-reload options for convenience
- Implement credit expiration policies (if applicable)

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### 5.1 Testing Strategy

- Test Stripe integration with test API keys
- Verify credit addition flow with test payments
- Test call duration tracking and credit deduction
- Validate edge cases (insufficient funds, failed payments)
- Perform security testing for payment flows

### 5.2 Deployment Plan

- Deploy database schema changes
- Implement feature behind feature flag
- Roll out to limited test users
- Monitor for issues and gather feedback
- Full production deployment

### 5.3 Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Set up monitoring for payment failures
- Track credit usage patterns
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Create alerts for system issues

## Phase 6: Optimization and Expansion

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

- Optimize database queries for credit operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed credit data
- Improve payment processing flow based on metrics

### 6.2 Feature Expansion

- Consider implementing subscription models
- Explore volume discounts for larger credit purchases
- Implement referral bonuses using credits
- Design promotional credit campaigns

## Technical Considerations

### Security

- Ensure PCI compliance for payment processing
- Implement proper authentication for credit operations
- Secure all API endpoints handling financial data
- Encrypt sensitive user and payment information

### Scalability

- Design system to handle concurrent credit operations
- Ensure database can scale with growing transaction volume
- Implement efficient credit calculation for high call volumes

### Compliance

- Ensure compliance with financial regulations
- Implement proper record-keeping for financial transactions
- Consider tax implications of digital credit sales
- Provide necessary receipts and transaction records

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 1 week
- Phase 6: Ongoing

Total estimated development time: 8 weeks
